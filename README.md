# Giraffe

Giraffe is a package that uses the functionality of 'git2r' 'daff' and
'xtable' to view the changes of a csv file that is in a git
repository.

This is a first draft! So nothing may work as expected

## Installation

```
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("giraffe", "trosendal")
```
